# Emnist Dataset for handwritten digits prediction
* The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19  and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset.

* This project was built to predict what the handwritten digit is, and if we supplied the model with a new image of a handwritten digit, it would predict it!
